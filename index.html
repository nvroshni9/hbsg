      <h2>Here's a small poem for you.</h2>
      <p class="intro">
          Be it "You are my fire",<br>
          Or "Give me reason,take me higher",<br>
          For this friendship to me has been a heck of a ride,<br>
          With this half human-half witch whom I truly admire..<br><br>
          
          I still remember ,back 8 years ago,<br>
          An alien from Russia was standing in the class alone,<br>
          I had no clue you would be my friend<br>
          The beauty witch who knows me better,i dont need to pretend<br>
          <br>
          
          For all those love stories i got to witness<br>
          Or the heart breaking lady that you got to be🤭<br>
          You taught me that life needs some chill,some fun,<br>
          To write my own story & realize "woah,thats me?"
          <br>
          <br>
          
          Lala-Jay-Sushi ya Jassi da smile 🤭<br>
          Those mems make me giggle,though its been long while<br>
          Im glad that the boat now has to settled for a mile🤭<br>
          And am Grateful to Uni for this yaari still alive<br>
          
          We have been and have not been there for each other,<br>
          But the thing is that we still do care about one another<br>
          This fevi quick bond proved our jealous teachers to be wrong<br>
          And also the guy who calls you a vampire,my poor fishy brother<br><br>
          
          
          Maybe someday our stories could put into a song,<br>
          Ive been missing you,since now it has been more than long<br>
          So eagerly waiting at home is your hopeful buddy ,<br>
          Somewhere near the door,For your ding dong🤭<br><br>
